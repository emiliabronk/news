LONDON, U.K., September 17th.

As reported by the BBC, four men were arrested after images of Donald Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were projected onto Windsor Castle on Tuesday, as the US president arrived in the UK for a state visit.

What the BBC failed to report was that in the later hours of the night, another image was projected upon the historic castle, used since the time of Henry I (who reigned 1100–1135).

Around 2 am EDT, or in the more standard form of GMT, at 7 AM, with a feeble attempt in broad daylight, a second set of images was displayed.

On both the left and right sides of the southwest towers, a coordinated attack was launched upon the surfaces. In the original photos, it is unnoticeable due to the nature of the daylight. Though when the exposure is raised to 150%, two images appear.

On the right, a seemingly explicit “fanfiction” between the international superstar Harry Styles and former President Barack Obama is displayed. A portion of the text is displayed below; viewer discretion is advised.

*“Barack’s throat went dry as Harry stepped out. He’d never grow tired of seeing one of the world’s most famous celebrities, standing in the Oval Office, wearing nothing but a silk negligee. The sheer black fabric complimented the tattoos adorning Harry’s lithe form. ‘You know, you shouldn’t be so bold,’ he said, mock-sternly, ‘I could have my security guards in here in seconds. What do you think they’d do if they saw you?’”*

The author, Harry Styles, has declined to comment on the new medium of his work.

On the left, a photo of President Donald Trump and former President Joseph Biden kissing was displayed. Viewer indiscretion is advised.

Buckingham Palace has not issued a formal statement. Pigeons roosting on the battlements, however, appeared “visibly disturbed,” according to onlookers.

Historians are now debating whether this represents Windsor Castle’s lowest moment since Camila was married here.

LONDON.
